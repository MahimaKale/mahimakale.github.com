        <h3>Project Summary:</h3>
        <p>I would like to update Project Every Picture as I want to get the circular scroll effect into my project. I also want to consider changing the content of the page but I am unsure about that. </p>

        </h3>

        <p>This website has caught my attention ever since I found it. I believe the experience of scrolling and the image going through a wheel sort of motion has a very organic feel to it. I also like the idea of the background staying the same as if you are grounded on the website and the content moving. The overall feel of the website is very cohesive with its colors and graphics. Sometimes there is a lot happening on the page and that I feel could be improved upon. They also have captured the essence of the band through the graphics behind the images. </p>

        <h3>Comparison Project 2: 
        </h3>
        <figure>

        <p>The circular scroll on the website is very smooth and playful. I actually really like the scroll on the right and the text on the left. It improves the readability of the text by so much. I admire the more information page pop open from the right as well. The background color has a very subtle gradient that keeps the attention in the center of the page. Even though the images sizes are very different they work well together.  </p>

        <h3>Project Goals:</h3>
        <p>The circular scroll is of course the common ground from both websites I discussed. The difference is the content and the tone of the web pages. I would want my page to have a view into my life and be more visually engaging than text heavy. My page is telling a different story from image rather than one continuous narrative. 
        </p>

        <h3>Design Strategies:</h3>
        <p>I want to change its soft tone to a darker one. I think I would also change the side of the scroll to make it more readable. I want to work on the hierarchy on the page as well and improve on how the eye flows on the page by itself.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Interaction Strategies: </h3>
        <p>The first strategy is also to get the scroll working. I want the flow of the scroll to be continuous and feel seamless. I want to add a loading page for a few seconds. I would, I think, add an indicator that says scroll in the corner. 
        </p>

        <h3>Experience Goals: 
        </h3>
        <p>I would want the users to get a feel of who I am through my attachments? It should be like a visual viewing experience into my life. There are so many tiny things that mean a lot to us in tiny fleeting moments in life. I would want viewers to look at my tiny animate object that I am attached and reflect on their own random attachments
