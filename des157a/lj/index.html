                <h3>Best practices for form design </h3>
                <p>Having the best practices to design a form would make or break a process. Reading the article by Salim Ansari made me realize the intricate details we oversee as tiny inconveniences that as designers we can solve and provide our users with an effortless form. </p>
                <p>I agree with most of the 20 points made in the article. One that I am on the fence with is the number “5. Distinguish Optional and Required fields”. I feel after filling out so many forms over time, asterisks help me quickly glance over with its bright red mark as to what is required. Perhaps it is the image used that shows “optional” text as right alight at the bottom that I believe does not work well visually because as a user who is in a rush to finish the form, I would just miss it and end up filling more than required information. </p>
                <p>Personally I have worked with and filled many google forms and I believe that it does a pretty good job usually with all the flexibility they provide the makers of the form with. As a form layout it does a good job with its labeling and the asterisks for required fields. More than a lot of other forms I have seen, the reason I think Google forms is better is because I am having a hard time thinking of a form that I believed gave me an effortless user flow which is truly concerning in retrospect. Reading this article made me realize how much as a user we accept tiny flaws in design that if removed could make a user’s experience so much better. </p>
