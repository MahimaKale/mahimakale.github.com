                <h3> The Priestess website </h3>
                <p>Looking at the heavy rock band Priestess was so refreshing. The Use of imagery to tell the story through a creative interactive display is so much fun. All of their pages are great but the “performance” page caught my attention. I enjoyed the use of a circular carousel that looks like vinyl!</p>
                    
                <p>Their “Story” page was inspiring to me. I loved the movement of the images. Looking at various websites I realize I enjoy the effect of scrolling down but the page moving sideways. There is one slide where the images are placed inside an arch shape and new images show up from the center of the arch. It was a very creative display of images and story telling. </p>
                    
                <p>I enjoyed the little details behind the images that were actually little croppings of their albums. The images used give an overall feel and tone of the band. It tells a story using brief sentences and more images. </p>

                <h3>Response to: Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows </h3>
                <p>Being completely new to the term Modals but knowing what they actually mean by having seen them before gave me a new perspective about them. I believe modals that I have seen before can be disruptive to a user flow if not used right. Reading about the best practices by Naema Baskanderi helped me solidify my idea about modals and understand how I can implement them responsibly in my designs. </p>
                <p>One thing that caught my attention is the note that said, </p>
                <blockquote>“Do not use to show error, success, or warning messages. Keep them on the page.”</blockquote>

                <p> This is interesting because I have seen most modals from websites as error messages, success or warning messages. 
                     </p>
                <p>Again like best best practice for form design, it is the tiny details that make a big difference in usability of a modal/overlays/dialog Windows. </p>

                <h3>Best practices for form design </h3>
                <p>Having the best practices to design a form would make or break a process. Reading the article by Salim Ansari made me realize the intricate details we oversee as tiny inconveniences that as designers we can solve and provide our users with an effortless form. </p>
                <p>I agree with most of the 20 points made in the article. One that I am on the fence with is the number “5. Distinguish Optional and Required fields”. I feel after filling out so many forms over time, asterisks help me quickly glance over with its bright red mark as to what is required. Perhaps it is the image used that shows “optional” text as right alight at the bottom that I believe does not work well visually because as a user who is in a rush to finish the form, I would just miss it and end up filling more than required information. </p>
                <p>Personally I have worked with and filled many google forms and I believe that it does a pretty good job usually with all the flexibility they provide the makers of the form with. As a form layout it does a good job with its labeling and the asterisks for required fields. More than a lot of other forms I have seen, the reason I think Google forms is better is because I am having a hard time thinking of a form that I believed gave me an effortless user flow which is truly concerning in retrospect. Reading this article made me realize how much as a user we accept tiny flaws in design that if removed could make a user’s experience so much better. </p>
