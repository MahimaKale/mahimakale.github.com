        <!-- Task, questions -->
        <section id="stuff">
            <h2>Observations:</h2>
            <h3>User 1</h3>
            <img src="images/1.jpeg" width="300px">
            <p>All tasks were accomplised but it took some time for the user to understand that they need to hover over the image to get more information about it.</p>
            <p>The user was squinting at the screen so probably improve on font and font arrangement of the text body.</p>
            <p>For task 2 user wrote down "soothing"</p>
            <h4>User one answers and feedback</h4>
            <p>The user did mention the paragraph could be arranged better. Some of the titles of the images seem a bit misaligned. The user also found a two typos in the body text.</p>
            <p>The User also suggested to add dates right under the titles or with the titles to add uniformity and a more cohesive and quick information grasping display. The tester enjoyed the color and a soothing effect to the page. They said that it was almost like soothing music feel but visually.</p>
            
            <h3>User 2</h3>
            <img src="images/2.jpeg" width="300px">
            <p>Again all tasks were completed except it took longer to find and undertstand the hover effecet to get more information. Everything else went smoothly with the tester.</p>
            <p>For task 2 user wrote down "artifacts"</p>
            <h4>User one answers and feedback</h4>
            <p>The User also suggested that there be some indication about the hover effect. Maybe just a little bubble that said that you can hover over the image.</p>
            <p>Another suggestion was to change teh location of the "scroll" icon to maybe in a circular way becasue the tester thought it would scroll down rather than just in a circle. The suggestion was also to use curcled arrow beside the central displaying image. The tester applauded the tranisitons and animation.</p>

            <h3>User 3</h3>
            <img src="images/3.jpeg" width="300px">
            <p>User 3 did not notice the hover effect altogether so definietly something that needs to be worked on. The tester was able to finish the rest of the tasks.</p>
            <p>For task 2 user wrote down "items with interesting memories for Mahima"</p>
            <h4>User one answers and feedback</h4>
            <p>the user did mention the paragraph could be arranged better. Some of the titles of the images seem a bit misaligned. The user also found a two typos in the body text.</p>
            <p>The User also suggested to add dates right under the titles or with the titles to add uniformity and a more cohesive and quick information grasping display.</p>
