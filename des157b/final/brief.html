    <h1>Project Brief</h1>
    <h2>Social/Political Construct of Race</h2>

    <section>
        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
        <p> A historical timeline responsive webpage of what the social construct of race is and how it changed over time, based on Abram X.Kendi’s book, “Stamped from the Beginning”.</p>
        <h3>Project Goals:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Show that the word and construct race has no singular meaning even today
            </li>
            <li>Collect what race means to people? A forum to share thoughts about the construct of race
            </li>
            <li>Display crucial historical events about construct of race as explained in the book by Kendi
            </li>
            <li>Make the historical timeline easy to understand and follow 
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Design Strategies: 
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I want to focus on making impact through big text for non timeline related content on the webpage. I want to fix two fonts, a serif and another non-serif for various big texts and written content. I want stubble circular and line graphics in the background of too much text.
            </li>
            <li>For the color, I want to use one of the beige colors from the cover of Stamped from the beginning and combine it with hues of blue and red call to actions.
            </li>
            <li> The page needs to have continuous flow to it as one section would be showing a timeline. 
            </li>
            <li>    For the share forum, I want to build on the metaphor of building the social construct of race? Like people are putting in their comments and thoughts, these would either be in jigsaw puzzle pieces or jenga pieces. To display something being constructed as our collective ideas about the term race is what race is going to mean tomorrow. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Interaction Strategies: 
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Landing page with a question, “What does the term race mean to you?” with an animation of a typing line blinking under it. The mouse would be a circle with a “click” text in the center of it.
            </li>
            <li>Next would be either “Understand history to make a systemic change”, or, “Racist ideas were built to last. Let’s start by tearing them down.”, or, another quote by Kendi. Again a mouse would be a circle with a “click” text in the center of it.
            </li>
            <li>Main page, text fills the page and one big word, “Race” in the center for the hero image. The background would be quotes I would collect from people. A little icon heading to the comment/sharing forum. 
            </li>
            <li>Scrolling available on the main page. Scrolling down after the hero image would be a timeline. Clicking on read more for each timeline will display more information about it on the screen. 
            </li>
            <li>For the share forum, It will display the previous comments and in the right top corner would be an “add” plus sign to add your own comment. 
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Experience Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Provoke thoughts about construct of race 
            </li>
            <li>Give a condensed timeline to understand how racist ideas were developed, disseminated, and enshrined in American society from Stamped from the Beginning book. Shedding light of the dark history. 
            </li>
            <li>Start a conversation about race and how we can eliminate hate.  
            </li>
        </ul>
