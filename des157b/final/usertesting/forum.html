            <p>The aim of this website is to start a conversation about race and what a racist idea is. It shows a <a href="home.html">historical timeline</a> for how the construct of race is woven into the roots of the making of America.</p><br>
            <p>The historical timeline is studied and inspired from the book <i>Stamped from the Beginning</i>, written by Ibram X.Kendi.</p><br>
            <p>We want to here your thoughts. Submit a response of what you think about the construct of race or what you think a racists idea is <a href="forum.html">here</a></p>
