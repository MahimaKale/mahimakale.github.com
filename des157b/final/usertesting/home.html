              The Book of Genesis records an instance of Noah cursing his son Ham's descendants to be slaves. Although there is no biblical evidence that Ham was the "father" of African people, various Jewish, Christian and Islamic writers came to believe that he was, and their association helped to justify centuries of African enslavement.

            <p>Hippocrates’s Airs, Waters, Places is considered to be the source document of climate-based theories of racial difference. In this treatise, Hippocrates describes the effects of different environments, diets, and customs on human disposition, including physical and moral susceptibilities to disease and humors. These differences are epitomized by European peoples, whom Hippocrates characterizes as ungovernable yet courageous as a result of their cold climate, and Asian peoples, who are characterized as peaceful but timid due to their hot climate.</p>

              <p>Ibn Batuta (Berber Maghrebi scholar and explorer who travelled extensively in the lands of Afro-Eurasia, largely in the lands of Dar al-Islam, travelling more than any other explorer in pre-modern history) said Nothing to fear about violence in Africa
