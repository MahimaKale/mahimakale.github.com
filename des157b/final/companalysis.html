        <p>This webpage is about the historic events TOMSK Polytechnic Uniersity. I like the dragging of years and the changing image effect on dragging. I also like the filling of the year that is selected.I envision my project to have dragging effect to change the years to show a timeline. Scrolling down gives more information on that year. I would not want this in specific but I like the historic and nostalgic tone of the webpage.</p>

        <p>This website is a tribute to four inspiring women. I chose this website becasue in Kendi's book he divides time up with five historical figures and goes way back in time to discuss where their ideologies stem from. Again here I like the draggable feature as well the graphical elements that are so visually simple yet pleasing. This page has information beautifully displayed. I would consider something like this to display more information about any of the events. The use of font and other display of timelines is very elegantly done. I like that the mouse shows the feature to be used for exmaple, if there is drag feature, the mouse says drag. I would consider using something like this in my project. The draggable feature is more in align with my project vision on this website.</p>
